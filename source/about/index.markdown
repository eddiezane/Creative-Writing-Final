This blog is to serve as a sanctuary for people who have tried to learn how to
program but were scared off as the learning curve ramped upwards. Each week a
video will be posted that focuses on one basic aspect of programming. It is
important to have a solid foundation of the ideals and pricipals that are shared
across all languages. Videos posted will range in time from 1 to 2 minutes and 
be very specific with their learning goal. Inspiration for this site has come 
from [code.org](http://code.org) and [Code Academy](http://codeacademy.com). If 
you feel that the rate which we are going at is too slow for you, then it might 
be in your best interest to check out on of them.
