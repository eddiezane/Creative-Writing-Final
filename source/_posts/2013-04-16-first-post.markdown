The purpose of this blog is to introduce complete beginners to the world of
programming. There will be weekly screencasts introducing a new topic in
programming. Some people are quickly intimidated by new things, escepcially when
 it comes to technology. We will be moving at a rather slow pace to make sure 
that no one is lost along the way. If you feel that the pace is too slow, then
you might be more comfortable checking out [codeacademy.](http://codeacademy.com)
