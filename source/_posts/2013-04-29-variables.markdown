Variables are used to hold values for us. Think back to your Algebra days where
you were asked to solve for ```x``` in a simple problem like ```2x = 6```. This 
was easily done by dividing both sides by ```2``` to get ```x = 3```. 

In programming, variables are used for the same purpose - to hold values.
Instead of trying to solve for them however, we assign them values to help us
solve problems. In this video we are going to go over the basics of variables.
